<strong>(1) The 2nd Workshop on Cyber threAt huNTing And inTelligence in heAlthcare (CANTATA)</strong><br> 


The 2nd Workshop on Cyber threAt huNTing And inTelligence in heAlthcare (CANTATA) 2024
 Co-located with the 6th International Conference on Science of Cyber Security - SciSec 2024, 14-16 August 2024, Copenhagen, Danmark, https://scisec.org/</br>


<h2><span lang=EN-US>SCOPE & TOPICS </span></h2>  
            The threat landscape in healthcare applications has become wider, and systems are prone to more sophisticated cyberattacks. Better proactive evidence collection, analytics and countermeasures are needed. Threat hunting and intelligence are potential for addressing these challenges.
Proactive, adaptive and dynamic threat hunting and intelligence approaches incorporate threat and evidence-driven knowledge to the target systems. This will allow systems to anticipate and mitigate threats well before they are realized and to prevent large-scale cybersecurity incidents in the world where cyberthreats are more and more emphasized and dynamical. 
The area of cyber threat hunting and intelligence research is evolving, but still lacks widely accepted methods and tools and applicable analysis techniques in healthcare. The effects of cyberthreats in healthcare services are not only restricted to data confidentiality and integrity but also, they may endanger precious lives. Therefore, new solutions for proactive, adaptive and dynamic threat hunting and intelligence are needed. In view of this, a strong research-based innovation and collaboration between healthcare experts, security experts, software architects and system developers are essential.
<br>
The workshop will provide a discussion platform for researchers in the field and an opportunity to share novel research on the topic. The outcome of the workshop will be an increased shared understanding of challenges and opportunities in systematic approaches to cyber threat hunting and intelligence, which are needed to support efficient construction and maintenance of secure healthcare systems.

Supported by the International Alliance for Strengthening Cybersecurity and Privacy in Healthcare (CybAlliance – https://cyballiance.nr.no/) project.

<strong>(2) Communication Network Security Workshop (ComNet-Sec)</strong><br> 


The communication network security workshop (ComNet-Sec) 2024 will be held with the 6th International Conference on Science of Cyber Security - SciSec 2024, 14-16 August 2024, Copenhagen, Danmark, https://scisec.org/</br>


<h2><span lang=EN-US>SCOPE & TOPICS </span></h2>  
          As we increasingly rely on communication networks for both personal and professional purposes, the variety and complexity of security threats they face are growing rapidly. The advent of new technologies like IoT and 5G has not only diversified potential attack vectors but also underscored the urgent need for advanced proactive defense strategies. Effective threat detection, thorough evidence gathering, smart analytics, and agile countermeasures are crucial to protect these critical infrastructures. Employing proactive, adaptable, and dynamic security approaches, which combine sophisticated threat intelligence and real-time data analysis, can greatly improve a network system's ability to foresee, identify, and neutralize potential threats before they lead to serious security breaches.
