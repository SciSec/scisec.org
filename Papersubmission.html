          <p>
            <strong>Submission System</strong><br>
	    Papers are submitted via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scisec2021" target="_blank">Easychair system</a></span>.</br><br>
	    <strong>Instruction to Authors</strong><br>
            <big><b><em>Types of Papers and Page Counts.</em></b></big> Submissions must be written in English and in the PDF format. Submissions should be made <b>anonymous</b> (i.e., no author names and affiliations information). Authors should use <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">Springer’s template</a> and the LaTeX templates are available at in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg" target="_blank">Overleaf</a>.
	    The most common types of papers accepted for publication are full papers (12-15 pages) and short papers (6-8 pages). A limited number of poster papers may be included, but these should not be shorter than 4 pages.</br>
	    <b><em>Figures.</em></b>All figures are printed in black and white, unless special arrangement has been made for colored figures. Colored figures remain in color in the online version. Please make sure that any colored figures are equally comprehensible in black and white. Figures and Tables should be cross referred in the text. We do not support color in text, tables or in equations.<br>
	
	    Submission of a paper is regarded as a commitment that at least one of its authors will register and attend the conference to present the work.<br><br>
            
	    <strong>IJDCF Submission System</strong><br>
	    Accepted posters will be invited to submit full version papers to IJDCF via the <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/calls-for-papers/international-journal-digital-crime-forensics/1112" target="_blank">IGI Global system</a></span>, which requires new template of materials. Submissions accepted by SciSec 2021, their extended version will also be accepted by IJDCF after a standard review process of IJDCF.
