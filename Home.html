        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2026</h1>
          <p> The 8th International Conference on Science of Cyber Security (SciSec 2025) will be held 29-31 May, 2026 in Beijing, China. 
            The conference is organized by the Beijing Institute of Technology. This new forum was initiated in 2018 and aims to catalyze the research collaborations between the relevant communities and disciplines that can work together to deepen our understanding of, and build a firm foundation for, the emerging Science of Cyber Security. 
            Publications in this venue would distinguish themselves from others by taking or thinking from a holistic perspective about cyber security, rather than a building-block perspective. 
            Each submission will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. </p>
          <p>Accepted paper will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by El.</p>
          <p>SciSec is on the list of international conferences recommended by IIE (IIE_C). </p>
          <p>A best student paper award and A best paper award. </p>

          <ul>
          	<li>Cybersecurity Dynamics
            <li>Cybersecurity Metrics and Their Measurements
<li>First-principle Cybersecurity Modeling and Analysis (e.g., Dynamical Systems, Control-Theoretic, and Game-Theoretic Modeling)

<li>Cybersecurity Data Analytics
<li>Quantitative Risk Management for Cybersecurity	
<li>Big Data for Cybersecurity
<li>Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity
<li>Machine Learning for Cybersecurity
<li>Economics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Social Sciences Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Statistical Physics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Complexity Sciences Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Experimental Cybersecurity
<li>Macroscopic Cybersecurity
<li>Statistics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Human Factors for Cybersecurity
<li>Compositional Security
<li>Biology-inspired Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Synergetics Approaches for Cybersecurity
  <ul>
  <p>It is stressed that it is the authors’ responsibility to explicitly justify the relevance of a submission to cyber security and how a submission is contributing to the Science of Cyber Security.</p>
  

  <p>The conference is in person, but we permit video /remote presentations under extreme circumstances as approved by general chair and PC chair with adequate justification (e.g., cannot get visa).</p>
