        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2026</h1>
          <p> The International Conference on Science of Cyber Security was initiated in 2018 by the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This forum aims to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of cybersecurity, to focus on the cutting-edge topics and key academic issues in the emerging Science of Cyber Security, and advance its in-depth exploration and research. The conference has been held seven times so far: SciSec 2025 (Wuhan, China), SciSec 2024 (Copenhagen, Denmark), SciSec 2023 (Melbourne, Australia), SciSec 2022 (Matsue, Japan), SciSec 2021 (Shanghai, China), SciSec 2019 (Nanjing, China), and SciSec 2018 (Beijing, China).Over 30
internationally renowned scholars and leading domestic experts in the field of cyberspace security have been invited to deliver keynote speeches. The 8th SciSec conference (SciSec 2026) will be hosted by Beijing Institute of Technology from May 29 to 31, 2026. </p>
          <p>Accepted paper will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by EI.</p>
          <p>SciSec is on the list of international conferences recommended by IIE (IIE_C). </p>
          <p>A best student paper award and A best paper award. </p>
