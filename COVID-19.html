        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2020</h1>
          <p> <strong>Notice!!!</strong></p>
          <p>Dear SciSec Community,</p>
          <p>The outbreak and ongoing development of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the increasing number of travel restrictions/bans by governments have forced us to postpone The Third SciSec, which was supposed to be held in Shanghai, China in August 2020, to be held in August 2021. We appreciate your patience and interest! Please stay safe and healthy. </p>
          
  <p>We are very sorry for the people who have already submitted their paper to SciSec.</p>
  <p>For the people who have already prepared their submissions, <a href=" https://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-digital-crime-forensics/1112" target="_blank"><strong>the special issue of International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics (IJDCF)</strong></a> is still open. </p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
 
     <p>Steering Committee, SciSec<br/>
        Organization Committee, The Third SciSec </p>>
