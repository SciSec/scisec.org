          <p><strong>Title: </strong>AI and Cybersecurity</p>
        
           <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI will have radical consequences for cybersecurity. Threat actors will weaponize AI to launch increasingly potent and destructive attacks. AI-based tools can create advanced deceptions and deepfakes that are already being used in real attacks, and the volume will only increase. To counter the threat of offensive AI, companies and research organizations are currently investing Big in the development of AI-based cyber defence technologies. Defenders need expertise in offensive uses of AI to better understand how defensive AI should work. In addition, the AI systems themselves can be the target of attacks, and hence we need to develop techniques for the defence of AI systems. This talk covers the basic principles of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning). Then it focuses on how AI is being used for both offensive and defensive purposes. Finally it focuses on how AI systems themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat actors, with possible ways to protect AI systems against such attacks.</p>
