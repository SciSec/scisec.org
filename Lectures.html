      <td id="GT"><strong>BIO:</strong> Shouhuai Xuis a gallogly chair professor in Cybersecurity, University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). He is the founding director of the Laboratory for Cybersecurity Dynamics (LCD). Hisresearch expertise is in Cybersecurity, including theoretical cybersecurity foundation, quantitative cybersecurity management and operations,and practical cybersecurity architectures and mechanisms.  He has served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (IEEE T-IFS) and for IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (IEEE TDSC) and is serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering (IEEE TNSE). He is/was a Program Committee co-chair of SciSec’2019, SciSec’2018, NSS’15 and Inscrypt’13. He co-initiated the new conference SciSec (International Conference on Science of Cyber Security) in 2018.He hasserved on the Program Committees of numerous international conferences/workshops. 2wwHe has pioneered the systematically approach of Cybersecurity Dynamics, which aims to quantify and manage cybersecurity and cyber defense operations from a holistic perspective.This approach is in herently multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, leading to publications across disciplines (including ACM Transactions, IEEE Transactions, Journal of Computer Security, Internet Mathematics, Technometrics, Journal of Applied Statistics, and Physical Review E). He received a PhD degree in Computer Science from Fudan University. </td>

      <td id="DU"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>Cybersecurity threats are increasingly hidden and sophisticated, and can easily bypass existing detection methods and tools. In this talk we present how we leverage behavior analytics using traffic and log data to detect novel cyber threats. At the same time, we are seeing and defending more and more attacks, how to automate the cybersecurity response lifecycle is a challenging problem. Here we present how we leverage modeling and orchestration methods to achieve automated response.</td>
